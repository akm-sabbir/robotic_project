automous robotic platform usig seeedruino board and atmega 128
So far I can remember about this project,

Seedruino board atmega128. loaded with FreeRTos operating system. Wrote three tasks. Ran them in Parallel.

Task1: read the input from servo motor. rotation per sec helps to determine the distance travelled.

Task2: IR sensor input. Helped to determine any obstacle close by distance. IR was mounted on the top of robotic platform.

Task3: Inertial Measurement Unit gave the Raw, Pitch and Yaw. Helped to determine the orientation and map generation.

How i programmed all the ports, used analog to digital conversion, interrupt signal even the board pin numbers, pin configuration
that i can not remember. i did this project a lot of time ago.
